# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

Given data on the number of rides, number of drivers, and total fare amount for each city type: urban, suburban, rural, this analysis was performed to determine the total fares by city type by each week for the first four months.

## Results

![Total Fares by City Type](https://github.com/MattK1454/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

Above is the graphic representation of the PyBer data filtered for the total fares by city type by weeks total. This data was built using a collection of drived data: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver to arrive at total fare by city type. From the graph, we can see that the urban city type has the highest total fare each week. We will look at each metric now to attempt to derive an understanding of what is happening in each city type for the PyBer company.

### Total Rides

- Rural: 125
- Suburban: 625
- Urban: 1,625

This data shows the urban city type has the highest total ride count, with the suburban city type having the second highest total ride count.

### Total Drivers

- Rural: 78
- Suburban: 490
- Urban: 2,405

This metric reveals that the urban city type possesses the highest total driver count out of all the city type with the suburban city type having the second highest total count.

### Total Fares

- Rural: $4,327.93
- Suburban: $19,356.33
- Urban: $39,854.38

Here, the metric shows the highest total fare sum belongs to the urban city type with the suburban city type coming in second.

### Average Fare per Ride

- Rural: $34.62
- Suburban: $30.97
- Urban: $24.52

By averaging out the total sum of fares with the number of rides, it can be noted that the highest average belongs to the rural city type with the suburban city type having the second highest average.

### Average Fare per Driver

- Rural: $55.48
- Suburban: $39.50
- Urban: $16.57

This metric was derived by averaging out the total fares sum with the number of drivers per city type. The result is the highest average fare per driver value belongs to the rural city type. The second highest average belongs to the suburban city type.

## Summary

From the above data, it is notable that the urban city has the highest number of both rides and drivers. The highest average fares per ride and per driver belong to the rural city type. With these observations I have 3 recommendations:

*1. 
*2. 
*3.
